## 💡 PRO TIPS

### For Working with Designers:

1. **Start with the Brief, Not the Spec**
   - Give them the 10-page brief first
   - After they understand the *why*, give them the *how* (60-page spec)

2. **The Prototype is Your North Star**
   - When reviewing designer work, compare to prototype
   - Ask: "Does this honor the cognitive load principles?"

3. **Protect the White Space**
   - Designers may want to fill empty space
   - Remind them: "30% white space minimum is non-negotiable"

4. **4th Grade Reading Level is Critical**
   - Use Hemingway Editor or readability tools
   - Aim for Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 4.0-5.0

5. **Consistency = Safety**
   - Daily journal pages must look identical
   - This is intentional, not lazy design

---

### For Using with MCP Automation:

1. **The Prompt is Comprehensive**
   - You can use the entire 60-page prompt as-is
   - Or extract specific sections for modular implementation

2. **Automation Scripts Included**
   - JavaScript snippets are in Part 9 of the technical doc
   - Copy/paste directly into InDesign Scripts panel

3. **Human Review Still Required**
   - Even with automation, review output carefully
   - Check emotion/tone (automation can miss subtlety)

---

## 🎨 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY REMINDER

This journizine is built on three core principles:

### 1. Cognitive Load Reduction
- White space = breathing room for overwhelmed minds
- Predictable structure = safety for anxious teens
- Simple language = accessibility for all

### 2. Cultural Competency
- Warm, earthy colors = healing (not clinical white)
- Affirming language = "you're not broken"
- Diverse representation = everyone sees themselves

### 3. Research-Backed Content
- 4th grade reading level = maximum accessibility
- Archetypes = identity exploration framework
- Shadow work = trauma-informed emotional processing

**Every design choice serves these principles.**

## 📞 NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Hire a Designer
1. Post job listing with DESIGNER_BRIEF_Quick_Reference.md
2. During interview, show altered_earth_journizine.pdf
3. Once hired, provide INDESIGN_MCP_AGENT_PROMPT.md
4. Set up milestone reviews

### Option B: Use InDesign MCP
1. Set up InDesign MCP if not already configured
2. Load INDESIGN_MCP_AGENT_PROMPT.md into agent
3. Provide all source files
4. Run automation
5. Review and refine output

### Option C: DIY in Canva/Other Tool
1. Use altered_earth_journizine.pdf as visual guide
2. Adapt DESIGNER_BRIEF principles to your tool
3. Simplify where needed (may not hit all specs)
4. Focus on: white space, consistency, warm colors

---

## 🚨 COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

1. **Don't sacrifice white space to fit more content**
   - If it doesn't fit, remove content, don't shrink spacing

2. **Don't make daily journal pages look different**
   - Repetition is the point (creates safety)

3. **Don't use academic language**
   - "Emotional regulation" → "Managing big feelings"
   - "Maladaptive coping" → "What you do that doesn't help"

4. **Don't hide the crisis resources**
   - Integrate throughout, make easy to find

5. **Don't use RGB color mode**
   - CMYK only for print (convert early)

6. **Don't skip the quality control checklist**
   - Found in Part 5, Phase 5 of technical doc
