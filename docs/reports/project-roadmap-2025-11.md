# Project Roadmap & Exit Strategy — November 10, 2025

## Vision
Position Feelings Unplugged as the go-to emotional regulation companion for underserved teens, while building a sustainable ecosystem of caregiver/educator tools that can scale into institutional partnerships or a mission-aligned acquisition.

## Strategic Objectives (12–24 Months)
1. **Product Excellence:** Deliver reliable, accessible, privacy-first experiences across web, print, and facilitator channels.
2. **Impact Validation:** Collect quantitative and qualitative proof of improved emotional literacy and self-regulation.
3. **Revenue Sustainability:** Layer monetization (print, subscriptions, training) without compromising free core access.
4. **Team & Ops:** Assemble a lean cross-functional team (product, marketing, clinical, operations).
5. **Optionality for Exit:** Maintain clean IP/data practices and documented impact to attract partners or acquirers.

## Roadmap Phases

### Phase 1 — Stabilize & Measure (Now → Feb 2026)
- Implement CI/CD (lint, build, Lighthouse) and automated tests.
- Redesign prompts UX/mobile flow; publish accessibility checklist.
- Deploy marketing site with analytics and email capture.
- Run teen beta cohort; gather insights, publish first case study.

### Phase 2 — Expand Offerings (Mar → Jul 2026)
- Release printed journizine (limited run) and track sales/feedback.
- Launch educator pilot program (curriculum kit + training sessions).
- Add optional account system (opt-in) for cross-device sync with strict privacy controls.
- Introduce referral program and ambassador network (teen leaders, educators).

### Phase 3 — Scale & Partner (Aug 2026 → Feb 2027)
- Secure 5–10 institutional agreements (schools, clinics, nonprofits).
- Expand content localization (Spanish, ASL resources) and accessibility features.
- Publish annual impact report (metrics, stories, partnerships).
- Evaluate funding options: strategic grants, aligned investors, or revenue-based financing.

## Exit / Scale Scenarios
- **Scale Independently:** Raise seed funding after hitting revenue milestones; hire small core team; pursue district-level contracts.
- **Strategic Partnership/Acquisition:** Maintain clean data and brand assets to appeal to SEL companies, mental-health platforms, or edtech nonprofits.
- **Nonprofit Collaboration:** Explore fiscal sponsorship or 501(c)(3) arm to unlock grants while keeping product arm sustainable.

## Risk Controls
- Document every major workflow (deployment, content updates, partnerships) inside `/docs/`.
- Retain ownership of all IP, media assets, and research; track contributor agreements.
- Establish regular financial reviews (monthly cashflow, runway).
- Create crisis response protocol (data handling, content moderation, user safety escalation).

## Key Decisions Upcoming
- **Marketing site hosting:** finalize deployment and analytics stack by end of November.
- **Monetization mix:** decide on primary paid offering after beta feedback (print vs facilitator subscription).
- **Team structure:** determine which roles to hire/contract first (likely marketing & community).
- **Data policy:** draft privacy policy and consent workflow prior to institutional pilots.
