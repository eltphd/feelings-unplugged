# Go-To-Market & Growth Strategy — November 10, 2025

## Product Positioning
- **Audience:** Gen Alpha/Z teens with high emotional sensitivity; caregivers & educators seeking trauma-informed tools.
- **Promise:** Evidence-based, culturally responsive emotional regulation that respects privacy (local-only data).
- **Differentiators:** Open access, archetype-based storytelling, privacy-first data handling, co-regulation resources for adults.

## Core Metrics (6-Month Targets)
- 500 monthly active teen users (≥3 check-ins/week).
- 250 caregiver email subscribers with 30% open rate.
- 5 institutional pilots (schools, clinics, youth orgs).
- Baseline retention: 40% 4-week active users.
- NPS ≥ 40 among teen cohort.

## 90-Day Launch Plan

| Phase | Weeks | Objectives | Deliverables |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Foundation | 1–2 | Finalize web app + marketing site presence | Deploy marketing pages; add analytics; publish product overview blog. |
| Audience Build | 3–6 | Grow awareness & collect leads | Content calendar (social + blog), launch email capture, secure 3 partner shout-outs. |
| Product-Led Growth | 7–10 | Validate value via beta cohorts | Teen beta (15–20 youth) with feedback loop, release weekly prompt pack, gather testimonials. |
| Monetization Prep | 11–13 | Define paid pathway | Pricing experiments (print journal, educator add-ons), draft pitch deck, identify grant opportunities. |

## Channels & Tactics
- **Content Marketing:** Publish weekly articles (brain science, caregiver scripts, teen stories). Repurpose into IG carousels and TikTok skits.
- **Partnerships:** Youth orgs, school counselors, mental health podcasts. Offer co-branded toolkits.
- **Email:** ConvertKit/Flodesk sequence—welcome, quick wins, weekly prompt challenge, caregiver tips.
- **Community:** Discord or Geneva micro-community for beta testers; host listening sessions.
- **PR:** Target education and wellness newsletters with launch announcement + case studies.

## Monetization Roadmap
1. **Freemium Core:** Web app remains free, fosters trust.  
2. **Paid Extensions (3–6 months):**  
   - Printed journizine (premium paper, limited editions).  
   - Educator toolkit subscription (lesson plans, analytics).  
   - Facilitator training/coaching bundles.  
3. **Institutional Revenue (6–18 months):**  
   - District-wide licenses or SEL program partnerships.  
   - Grant-backed research pilots tracking emotional health outcomes.

## Team & Ops
- Immediate needs: Fractional marketing lead, community manager, clinical advisor.
- Document roles, SOPs, and brand toolkit (store in `/branding/`).
- Build investor/partner data room: traction metrics, financial model, roadmap, testimonials.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Burnout / Solo bandwidth:** Prioritize tasks with high leverage; outsource design/content when possible.
- **Compliance & Privacy:** Draft privacy policy, backup options, review COPPA/FERPA implications before working with minors in institutional settings.
- **Measurement Gaps:** Implement analytics (with consent) and qualitative feedback loops to prove efficacy.

## Next Actions
1. Deploy marketing site with analytics and top-level nav.  
2. Launch email list + lead magnet (starter kit PDF).  
3. Recruit beta teens (application form + parental consent template).  
4. Schedule partner outreach sprint (identify 10 targets, send 5 invitations/week).  
5. Draft financial model covering free core + paid extensions for 24 months.
