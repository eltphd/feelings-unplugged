**Deliverable:** 120-page journal + magazine hybrid for teens  
**Timeline:** [Insert timeline]  
**Budget:** [Insert budget]

## WHAT YOU'RE CREATING

A 120-page "journizine" (journal + magazine) for teens ages 13-18 experiencing big emotions. It alternates between:
- **40% Educational articles** (written at 4th grade reading level)
- **60% Interactive journaling** (prompts, templates, creative space)

**Core purpose:** Help teens regulate emotions through research-backed content with reduced cognitive load.

---

## KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES (CRITICAL)

### 1. **Cognitive Load Reduction**
- **30% white space minimum** on every page
- **Predictable structure** (daily journal pages look identical every day)
- **Visual breaks** every 2-3 pages (images, fact boxes, doodle space)
- **Decision reduction** (fill-in-the-blank > open-ended questions)

### 2. **Reading Level: 4th Grade**
- Sentence length: 10-15 words max
- Common vocabulary only (no jargon)
- Active voice ("You feel" not "Emotions are felt")
- Visual supports on every page

### 3. **Rhythm = Regulation**
Every 12 pages follows this pattern:
- **LEARN** (4 pages): Read educational content
- **PRACTICE** (6 pages): Interactive prompts
- **REST** (2 pages): Visual/creative space

## CRITICAL DO'S & DON'TS

### ✅ DO:
- Embrace white space (30% minimum per page)
- Use exact same layout for daily journals (predictability = safety)
- Keep language at 4th grade level (short sentences, simple words)
- Apply warm, affirming tone ("You're not broken" not "Fix yourself")
- Include validation after hard prompts ("This is normal")
- Make crisis resources visible (not hidden in back)
- Use left-aligned text (never justified)
- Color-code emotions and archetypes consistently

### ❌ DON'T:
- Cram content to fit everything (less is more)
- Use light gray for body text (always black)
- Make daily pages look different (consistency is key)
- Use academic or clinical language (teen-friendly only)
- Justify text (creates uneven spacing, harder to read)
- Use bright, saturated colors (warm/muted only)
- Hide the crisis hotlines (integrate throughout)
- Sacrifice white space for more content

## QUESTIONS TO ASK ME

Before starting, ask:
1. Do you have the Crimson Text font installed?
2. Do you have access to all source files?
3. Timeline: When do you need this completed?
4. Who will be writing the articles that need to be created?
5. Do you have image assets (firefly illustrations, body outline, etc.) or should I create placeholders?
6. Printing: Do you have a print vendor selected? (affects color profile)

1. **altered_earth_journizine.pdf** - Visual prototype showing layout examples

## FINAL REMINDER

**This is not just a journal. This is a mental health tool for vulnerable teens.**

Every design choice matters:
- White space = breathing room for overwhelmed minds
- Predictable layouts = safety for anxious teens
- Simple language = accessibility for all reading levels
- Warm colors = healing, not clinical coldness
- Validation language = "you're not broken" message throughout

**Honor the responsibility. Design with intention. Reduce cognitive load.**
