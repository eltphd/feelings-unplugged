# Feelings Unplugged - Design Brief & Brand Guidelines

## Current Problem
❌ **What's Not Working:**
- Yellow (#f4c430) on beige (#fafaf8) feels washed out

## Brand Core

- **Parents:** Navigating adolescent mental health with cultural competence
- **Educators:** Creating emotionally intelligent classrooms

### Brand Voice
- Authentic, not performative
- Depth over surface
- Trauma-informed and culturally responsive
- "Your brilliance is not conditional"

## Visual Direction Questions

### 1. Color Mood (Pick 1-2)
- [ ] **Warm & Comforting** (terracotta, warm neutrals, soft oranges)
- [ ] **Cool & Calming** (sage green, soft blues, lavender)
- [ ] **Rich & Grounded** (deep teal, burgundy, forest green)
- [ ] **Vibrant & Energetic** (coral, bright turquoise, sunset colors)
- [ ] **Neutral & Sophisticated** (charcoal, cream, gold accents)

### 2. Contrast Preference
- [ ] **High Contrast** (dark text on light, crisp and readable)
- [ ] **Medium Contrast** (softer but still clear)
- [ ] **Low Contrast** (dreamy, subtle)

### 3. Aesthetic References (Which resonates?)
- [ ] **Modern Mental Health** (Headspace, Calm - soft pastels, rounded shapes)
- [ ] **Elevated Wellness** (Glossier, Sakara - minimalist, sophisticated)
- [ ] **Academic but Warm** (University branding - credible but approachable)
- [ ] **Creative/Artistic** (Behance, Dribbble - bold colors, expressive)
- [ ] **Indie Publishing** (Small press books - texture, warmth, character)

### 4. Firefly Metaphor - How should it show up?
- [ ] **Literal** (actual firefly imagery, light particles)
- [ ] **Conceptual** (warm glow effects, light/shadow contrast)
- [ ] **Minimal** (subtle accent, not the main visual theme)
- [ ] **Skip it** (find a different metaphor)

## Design System Framework

### Color Psychology for Mental Health
**What to avoid:**
- Overly bright/neon (can trigger anxiety)
- Pure white backgrounds (harsh, clinical)
- Too dark (can feel heavy for depression/anxiety)

**What works:**
- Warm neutrals with grounding earth tones
- Soft, muted colors with adequate contrast
- Colors that feel like a warm hug, not a sterile clinic
