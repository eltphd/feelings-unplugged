# Feelings Unplugged Repository

## 📁 Repository Location

- ✅ All latest commits

## 🚨 Important: GitHub Desktop Setup

If you see TWO "feelings-unplugged" folders in GitHub Desktop:

1. **Keep this one:** `/Users/tarttphd/Documents/GitHub/feelings-unplugged`
2. **Remove the other one from GitHub Desktop:**
   - Right-click on the Downloads folder version
   - Select "Remove Repository" (this won't delete the folder, just removes it from GitHub Desktop)

## 🔄 Syncing Both Folders (Optional)

If you want both folders to stay in sync:

```bash
# Update Downloads folder (run from Downloads folder)
cd /Users/tarttphd/Downloads/feelings-unplugged
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```

## 📍 Which Folder to Use?

**Always use:** `/Users/tarttphd/Documents/GitHub/feelings-unplugged`

This is the primary repository with all the latest work.

## 🗑️ Cleaning Up (Recommended)

To avoid confusion, you can:
1. Remove the Downloads folder from GitHub Desktop
2. Keep using only the Documents/GitHub folder
3. Archive or delete the Downloads folder if no longer needed
