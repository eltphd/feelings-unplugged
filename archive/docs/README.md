# Archived Documentation

These files are preserved for historical context but superseded by the docs in `../docs/`:

- `EFFICIENCY_REVIEW.md` – pre-launch efficiency review (November 2024)
- `README_REPOSITORY.md` – legacy folder-location reminder
- `REPOSITORY-CLEANUP-REPORT.md` – snapshot of the repo before the firefly redesign

If you need guidance for current workflows, start with the docs in `../docs/`.
