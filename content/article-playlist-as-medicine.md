### PLAYLIST AS MEDICINE
**How music changes your mood (and how to use it)**

---

Have you ever felt sad, then played a song that made you cry even more—and somehow, you felt better?

Or maybe you were nervous before a big game, so you put on your pump-up playlist and felt braver?

That's not magic. That's your brain.

**Music is medicine for your feelings.**

And the best part? You already know how to use it.

## PAGE 2: THE SCIENCE (SIMPLE)

### YOUR BRAIN ON MUSIC

When you listen to music, your brain releases chemicals that change how you feel.

Here's what happens:

**When you listen to a song you love:**
- Your brain releases dopamine (the "feel-good" chemical)
- Your heart rate can slow down or speed up (depending on the beat)
- Your body relaxes or gets energized

**When you listen to sad music when you're sad:**
- It's called "matching your mood"
- Your brain feels understood (like someone gets it)
- Crying to music can actually help you feel better

**When you listen to upbeat music:**
- Your brain gets energized
- You might feel more confident
- It can help you focus or move your body

---

### DID YOU KNOW?

**Music can:**
- Lower stress (slow songs help you calm down)
- Give you energy (fast songs pump you up)
- Help you remember things (that's why songs get stuck in your head)
- Make you feel less alone (lyrics that say what you feel)

## PAGE 3: THE 5 PLAYLISTS

### BUILD YOUR EMOTIONAL TOOLKIT

Think of playlists like a first-aid kit—but for your feelings.

When you feel a big emotion, you can pick the playlist that matches.

Here are the 5 playlists everyone should have:

---

### 1. MAD PLAYLIST
**When you're angry and need to let it out**

Songs that:
- Have loud guitars or drums
- Match your anger (don't fight it, feel it)
- Help you scream or move your body

**Why it works:** Your brain needs to release the anger. Music gives it a safe place to go.

**Example vibes:** Rock, punk, rap with heavy beats

---

### 2. SAD PLAYLIST
**When you need to cry or feel your feelings**

Songs that:
- Are slow and soft
- Have lyrics that say what you feel
- Make you cry (and that's okay)

**Why it works:** Crying releases stress hormones. Sad music helps you let it out.

**Example vibes:** Ballads, slow R&B, acoustic songs

---

### 3. HAPPY PLAYLIST
**When you want to celebrate or feel good**

Songs that:
- Make you want to dance
- Have happy lyrics
- Remind you of good times

**Why it works:** Upbeat music boosts dopamine (the happy chemical).

**Example vibes:** Pop, funk, dancehall, happy indie

---

### 4. CALM PLAYLIST
**When you need to breathe and slow down**

Songs that:
- Are gentle and quiet
- Have no lyrics (or soft ones)
- Feel like a warm blanket

**Why it works:** Slow music lowers your heart rate and helps your body relax.

**Example vibes:** Lo-fi, classical, nature sounds, soft jazz

---

### 5. HYPED PLAYLIST
**When you need energy or confidence**

Songs that:
- Have a strong beat
- Make you feel like a superhero
- Pump you up before something big

**Why it works:** Fast music gets your adrenaline going. It tricks your brain into feeling braver.

**Example vibes:** Hip-hop, EDM, hype rap, workout music

### HOW TO USE YOUR PLAYLISTS

**Step 1: Name your emotion**
Ask yourself: "How do I feel right now?"

**Step 2: Pick the matching playlist**
Don't try to "fix" your emotion. Match it first.

**Step 3: Let the music do its work**
Listen. Cry. Dance. Scream into a pillow. Move your body. It's all okay.

**Step 4: Notice how you feel after**
Did it help? Do you feel lighter? If yes, add more songs to that playlist.

---

### REMEMBER:

**There's no "right" music.**
Whatever helps YOU feel better is the right choice.

**You can update these anytime.**
Songs that help you today might change next month. That's normal.

**Music isn't a cure—it's a tool.**
If you're feeling really bad every day, talk to an adult you trust. Music can help, but sometimes you need more support. And that's okay.
