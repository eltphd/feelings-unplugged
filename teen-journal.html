                <p>
                    This isn't another gratitude journal with surface-level prompts. <em>Feelings Unplugged</em>
                    is designed for teens who are ready to explore the complexity of their inner world—the parts
                    they show the world and the parts they hide, even from themselves.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combining Jungian psychology, neuroscience, and culturally responsive frameworks, this journal
                    guides you through transformative self-discovery without judgment or prescription.

                        <em>"I created this journal because I needed it as a teen and it didn't exist. Too many
                        resources offer platitudes when you're navigating real complexity—cultural dissonance,
                        identity fragmentation, emotional overwhelm. This journal honors that complexity. It
                        doesn't promise easy answers. It offers companionship for the journey into your depths."</em>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Do I need therapy experience to use this journal?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. While informed by therapeutic frameworks, this journal is designed for independent use.
                    However, it can complement therapy beautifully. If you're working with a therapist, consider
                    sharing your journal entries during sessions.
                </p>

                <h3>What if the prompts feel too intense?</h3>
                <p>
                    Skip them. Come back later. Go at your pace. There's a "regulation toolkit" section specifically
                    for moments when emotional intensity feels overwhelming.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this culturally appropriate for all teens?</h3>
                <p>
                    The journal includes frameworks for cultural identity exploration and explicitly honors diverse
                    experiences. However, it's written from a Western psychology lens integrated with cultural humility.
                    Use what resonates; adapt what doesn't.
                </p>

                <h3>Can parents/teachers read this with teens?</h3>
                <p>
                    The journal is designed for teen privacy and autonomy. We recommend teens decide what (if anything)
                    they want to share. For guided family/classroom work, see our Parent Guide and Educator Toolkit.
