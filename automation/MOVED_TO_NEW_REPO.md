# Automation Files Moved

The Airtop Daily Planner automation files have been moved to a dedicated automations repository.

## New Location

**Repository:** https://github.com/drtarttphd/drtarttphd-automations
**Folder:** `personal-productivity/`

## Files Moved

- `airtop-daily-planner.ts` → Now at `/personal-productivity/airtop-daily-planner.ts`
- `AIRTOP_PLANNER_DEBUG_REPORT.md` → Now at `/personal-productivity/DEBUG_REPORT.md`

## Why Moved?

These automation files were moved to a dedicated business automations repository that organizes automations by team and function:

- marketing/
- creatives/
- financials/
- tech/
- operations/
- personal-productivity/ (contains the daily planner)
- shared-utilities/

This separation keeps the feelings-unplugged repository focused on the journal product while maintaining a clean, organized location for all business automations.

## Local Path

The new repository is located at: `/home/user/drtarttphd-automations/`

## Next Steps

See `GITHUB_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` in the new repository for instructions on:
1. Creating the GitHub repository
2. Pushing the code to GitHub
3. Adding future automations
