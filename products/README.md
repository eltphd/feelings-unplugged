# Product Files for Feelings Unplugged

## Teen Journal PDF

**Files:**

- `Teen-Journal-Feelings-Unplugged.pdf` (legacy layout generated by an automated agent)
- `teen-journal-print.html` (new scholar studio layout ready for print/PDF export)

The HTML file renders the redesigned print edition that matches the current web/app branding. Use your browser’s “Print → Save as PDF” (set paper size Letter, margins 0.5" or default) to generate the updated PDF. The legacy PDF is kept for reference but should be replaced everywhere with the new export.
