                <h2>You Don't Have to Have All the Answers</h2>
                <p>
                    Parenting a teen through emotional challenges can feel isolating, overwhelming, and uncertain.
                    You might worry you're doing it wrong. You might feel helpless when your child is in pain.
                    You might struggle with when to intervene and when to step back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This guide won't give you a script—because every teen, every family, every cultural context
                    is unique. What it <em>will</em> give you is a framework: evidence-based strategies, culturally
                    responsive tools, and compassionate guidance for showing up for your teen while honoring your
                    own limitations.

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What if my teen refuses help?</h3>
                <p>
                    The guide includes strategies for supporting resistant teens, including motivational interviewing
                    techniques and how to differentiate between healthy autonomy and concerning avoidance.
                </p>

                <h3>Is this a substitute for therapy?</h3>
                <p>
                    No. This guide helps you navigate <em>when</em> to seek therapy, <em>how</em> to find culturally
                    competent providers, and <em>what</em> to do while waiting for appointments or between sessions.
                </p>

                <h3>Will this work for neurodivergent teens?</h3>
                <p>
                    Many strategies are applicable, but this guide isn't specifically tailored to ADHD, autism, or
                    other neurodevelopmental differences. We recommend pairing it with neurodiversity-affirming resources.
                </p>

                <h3>What if I'm a single parent or co-parenting with conflict?</h3>
                <p>
                    The guide includes sections on navigating mental health support across different households,
                    managing disagreements about care, and resourcing yourself when you're doing it alone.
