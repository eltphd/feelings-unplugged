                <h2>Introduction: Why This Matters</h2>
                <p>
                    Your teen is navigating the most emotionally complex phase of human development. Their brains are
                    literally rewiring, their identities are forming, and the world is asking them to be adults while
                    treating them like children.
                </p>
                <p>This guide helps you:</p>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li>Understand adolescent emotional development</li>
                    <li>Support without controlling</li>
                    <li>Navigate crisis moments</li>

                    <li>Recognize when to intervene vs. when to witness</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Your job isn't to fix your teen's emotions. It's to create safety for them to feel.</p>

                <h2>Understanding Adolescent Emotional Development</h2>

                <h3>What's Happening in Their Brain</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ages 13-18:</strong> The prefrontal cortex (impulse control, planning, emotional regulation)
                    is under construction. The amygdala (emotional reactivity) is fully online. This is why teens:
                </p>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li>Feel emotions more intensely than adults</li>
                    <li>Struggle with emotional regulation</li>
                    <li>Take risks without thinking through consequences</li>
                    <li>Seem "moody" or "dramatic" (they're not being difficult—their brain is doing its job)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <strong>Ages 18-25:</strong> The brain continues developing. Executive function improves, but
                    emotional volatility can persist, especially under stress.
                </p>

                <h3>Identity Formation</h3>
                <p>Adolescence is when your teen answers: <em>Who am I when I'm not defined by my family?</em></p>
                <p>This includes:</p>
                <ul class="features">
                    <li><strong>Social identity:</strong> Friend groups, subcultures, online communities</li>
                    <li><strong>Cultural/racial identity:</strong> Understanding their place in societal hierarchies</li>
                    <li><strong>Gender/sexual identity:</strong> Exploring who they're attracted to, how they express gender</li>
                    <li><strong>Values:</strong> What they believe independent of what you taught them</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Your role:</strong> Hold space for exploration, even when their choices differ from yours.</p>

                    <p>Your teen's emotional journey isn't linear. There will be bad days, hard weeks, and moments where you feel helpless. That's normal.</p>

                    <p><strong>Remember:</strong></p>
                    <ul class="features">
                        <li>Your presence matters more than perfection</li>
                        <li>Trust is built through repair, not avoiding rupture</li>
                        <li>Your teen is figuring out who they are—let them</li>
                        <li>You're doing better than you think</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;"><strong>The goal isn't to raise a "happy" teen. It's to raise an emotionally intelligent adult who knows how to feel, process, and ask for help.</strong></p>

                    <p>You've got this.</p>
