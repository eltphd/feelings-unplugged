                <h2>You Can't Teach a Dysregulated Student</h2>
                <p>
                    You've likely heard this truth echoed in professional development, but what are you supposed
                    to <em>do</em> about it when you have 30 students, a packed curriculum, and no training in
                    mental health intervention?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This toolkit isn't asking you to be a therapist. It's giving you evidence-based, trauma-informed,
                    culturally responsive tools you can implement <strong>today</strong>—in 5-minute bursts, with
                    no additional budget, and minimal classroom disruption.

                <p><strong>Core Principle:</strong> Emotional regulation isn't a "nice-to-have" for academic success.
                It's the foundation. These tools help students access their learning brain.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>Do I need admin approval to use these strategies?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most strategies are within a teacher's scope of practice (grounding exercises, check-ins, etc.).
                    However, if your district has specific SEL policies, review those first. The toolkit includes
                    guidance on presenting SEL integration to admin.
                </p>

                <h3>How much class time does this take?</h3>
                <p>
                    Most interventions are 5 minutes or less. Lesson plan templates are designed to integrate SEL
                    into existing curriculum, not add to your plate.
                </p>

                <h3>Will this work with high schoolers or just younger kids?</h3>
                <p>
                    All strategies are adaptable across K-12. The toolkit includes age-specific modifications for
                    elementary, middle, and high school contexts.
                </p>

                <h3>What if my students are resistant to "feelings talk"?</h3>
                <p>
                    The toolkit includes strategies for framing emotion regulation as "focus" or "performance optimization"
                    for students who find SEL language cringeworthy. It's about meeting students where they are.
